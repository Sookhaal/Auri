* Auri
Auri is a modular python script launcher.
The main idea is to build a library of scripts (we call them *modules*) and have a shell (Auri) executing the stacked scripts in a top to bottom order.

Auri is confirmed to work on Modo, Maya, Houdini and as a standalone application.

* How it works
The =scripts= folder contains *categories* and *subcategories* (subfolders) which contain *modules* (python scripts).
Auri lets you select a category, a subcategory and a corresponding script and *add* it to the list of scripts to execute.

A module can have a custom UI (view) and logic associated to it.
