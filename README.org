* Auri
Auri is a modular python script launcher.
The main idea is to build a library of scripts (we call them *modules*) and have a shell (*Auri*) executing the stacked scripts (we call it the *stack*) in a top to bottom order.

Auri is confirmed to work on Modo, Maya, Houdini, Nuke and as a standalone application.

* How it works
The =scripts= folder contains *categories* and *subcategories* (subfolders) which contain *modules* (python scripts).
Auri lets you select a category, a subcategory and a corresponding script and *add* it to the list of scripts to execute.

A module can have a custom UI (view) and logic associated to it.

You can save & load the stack and its settings in order to reuse and share it with your team.

* Who is using it?
Auri is used at [[http://www.artfx.fr/en/][ArtFX]] for the 5th year's graduation projects, mainly for the rigging process.
